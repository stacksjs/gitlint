# A Better Developer Experience

> A TypeScript Starter Kit that will help you bootstrap your next project without minimal opinion.

# bun-ts-starter

This is an opinionated TypeScript Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next Bun package.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/ts-starter my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._

# Introduction to GitLint

GitLint is a lightweight, customizable Git commit message linter that helps teams maintain consistent, high-quality commit histories. By enforcing structured commit messages, GitLint makes codebases easier to maintain, changelog generation more straightforward, and team collaboration smoother.

## Why Use GitLint?

Maintaining a clean and consistent commit history is essential for several reasons:

- **Clear project history**: Well-formatted commits make it easier to understand changes over time
- **Automated semantic versioning**: Structured commits enable automatic version bumping based on commit types
- **Streamlined changelog generation**: Properly formatted commits can be automatically compiled into readable changelogs
- **Better code reviews**: Descriptive commits make the review process more efficient
- **Improved collaboration**: Standardized messages help team members understand each other's changes

## Key Features

GitLint offers a comprehensive set of features to help enforce your team's commit message conventions:

### Conventional Commits Support

GitLint enforces the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard by default, ensuring your commits follow a semantic format like:

```
feat(component): add ability to parse @mentions
```

### Customizable Validation Rules

Configure GitLint to match your team's specific commit message standards with rules such as:

- Header length restrictions
- Body line length limits
- Required blank lines between sections
- Whitespace validations
- Issue reference formatting

### Git Hooks Integration

Seamlessly integrate GitLint with Git hooks to validate commits before they're created, ensuring your repository always maintains the expected standard.

### Flexible Configuration

Customize GitLint to match your project's needs through a simple configuration file that can be committed to your repository and shared across your team.
